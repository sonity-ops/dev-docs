# Intro

Let's discover **Sonity in less than 5 minutes**.

## What is Sonity

Sonity is a LinkedIn automation tool that is build based on the Microservices Architecture Pattern. This pattern allows you break a system into a set of units that can be build, deployed and scaled separately.

## What you will get 

This documentation aims to shed a light on the following

#### [1. Sonity System](./Sonity%20System/what-is-sonity)

This will give a bird eye view of how the sonity system works as a whole


#### [2. Microservices](./Microservices/intro.md) 
This will guide you through each microservice.

Given a microservice you will get the following:
1. How it works and how it serves the bigger picture
2. How to install it, configure it and deploy it
3. Code documentaion

#### [3. Tools](./Tools/_category_.json)
As part of our development we can come up with tools that may not be deployed in the production environment but we use them in our development environments

This section will teach you how each tool works.

## What you'll need

Most of these microservice are build using Nodejs

- [Podman](https://podman.io/): 
Manage containers. Works seamlessly with Kubernetes.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
Manage containers

- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/):
