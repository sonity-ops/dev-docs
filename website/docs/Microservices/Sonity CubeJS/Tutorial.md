# How it Works

Here is some of the important information that you might important


## Charting Library
Cube JS doesnt provide a visualiation layer so people use a Charting library of their choice. 

Here at Sonity we use [React Chart JS](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) to display the charts on the Portal Example project.


## Frontend Integration
To integrate Cube JS on the frontend we make use of the the [Cube JS SDK](https://cube.dev/docs/product/apis-integrations/javascript-sdk)
