Sonity built on the Mircoservices Architecture Pattern.

This pattern allows you to break the system into a set of services that are:
- Indipendently deployable and scalable
- Loosely coupled

These microservices are then packaged into containers and deployed inside the Kubernetes cluster.

Of course this is very watered-down example, but you get the idea.
